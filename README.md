For this project I wanted to showcase that I understand the fundamentals of python. I was speaking to a professional developer and he said that the no starch press python books were outstanding resources to utilize. I grabbed a copy of The Big Book of Small Python Projects and found a project that I absolutely wanted to tackle. The hacking.py project is actually a mini game inside of one of my favorite video games Fallout 3. You have to guess the password and break into the persons computer with only a limited number of guesses. You can see a link to the book I am referencing here: https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/

Setup: 

Setup for this project is quite simple. 

First you can use an editor that can handle python. A simple free editor that I use is Visual Studio Code. 
Visual Studio Code runs on multiple operating systems. You can find the download link by searching for it in google or
clicking the link here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview 

Run throught the installer and follow all of the prompts. If you get stuck Tech with Tim also does a great job explaining how to set it up as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORrELERGIHs&t=596s

Next we need to download python. The link for downloading python can be found here. Like visual studio code, python can run on all 
operating systems. Follow the instructions of the installer. Also included is a youtube link for how to install visual studio code and python.

The last step is pulling down the code from github. 
Go to this Github Link: https://github.com/strikeouts27/python_hacking_game

You will see a green button called code. Click the green button and click download zip. You will download the code needed for this project. Once the code is downloaded move that folder to your desktop file or to a place where you want to store it and open it. Than use visual studio code to open the file with the file open folder command. Select the folder with hacking.py code. After that activate the terminal using the menu bar at the top and select new terminal. After activating the terminal inside of visual studio code type in pwd to see what folder you have selected. If you see /python_hacking_game as part of the outputted line you are in the right place. opening the file should place you in this directory. go ahead and type ls and you should see a list of files inside the python_hacking_game folder. if you see andrews_hacking.py you are in the right spot. 

Type in python andrews_hacking.py on windows or python3 andrews_hacking.py on mac and the game should start! Please enjoy!
